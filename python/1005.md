strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.
a = "Hello, Angelle"
print(a[7])

# strings == > array
# index begins with 0
Strings are Arrays ==> acces the elemet of arrays
Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1
a = "Hello, Fighter"
print(a[4])

# strings == > array
# index begins with 0
Looping Through a String
for x in "Go Dreamer":
  print(x)
String Length:To get the length of a string, use the len()function.
a = "Hello, Blue Eagle!"
print(len(a))
# wrong: print(length(a))
QUIZ:tell me how many char appear in "dshdsjadhsjahdsjhdecwej dsaksdjl"

a = "dshdsjadhsjahdsjhdecwej  dsaksdjl"
print(len(a))
# wrong: print(length(a))
# 33 = 31 letter 2 space
Check String:To check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use the keyword in.
keyword in vs if
True or False
txt = "The best things in life are free!Gofor it "
# print("free" in txt) == > True
# print("Gofor" in txt) == > True
print("Gofo" in txt)  # False
txt = "The best things in life are free!Itrust you "
if "trust you" in txt:
  print ("trust you, 'free' is present.")

txt = "The best things in life are free!Itrust you "
if "trust you" in txt:
  print ("trust you, 'free' is present.")

``` python
txt = "The best things in life are free!HDJSAdhjs  dhsjahd32 dsaDJHSajdh "
if "HJSAdhj" in txt:
  print("Yes, 'HJSAdhj' is present.")

b = "Hello, Angelle !"

- Python - Modify Strings
- The upper() method returns the string in upper case:
- The lower() method returns the string in lower case
b = "Hello, Figther!"
print(b.upper())
- Remove Whitespace with strip() method
- The strip() method removes any whitespace from the beginning or the end
b = " Hello, Angelle! "
print(b.strip())
- The replace()method replaces a string with another string
- seperator
b = " Hello, Figther! "
print(b.replace("o", "w"))

b = " Hello, Fighter! "
print(b.split(","))

b = " Hello, Fighter! "
print(b.split("F"))

- String Concatenation:To concatenate, or combine, two strings you can use the + operator.
a = "Hello"
b = " , "
c = "Angelle"
d = a + b + c
print(d)
Hello , Angelle

- Python - Format - Strings
age = 19
txt = "My name is Angelle , and I am {}"
print(txt.format(19))
My name is Angelle , and I am 19



quantity = 3
itemno = 567

txt = "Hello, And Welcome To My World!"

x = txt.casefold()

print(x)
